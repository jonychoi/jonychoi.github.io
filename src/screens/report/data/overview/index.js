            description: `I remember what I said when I first met the professor in the lab. "I'm going to explore deeply where we come from, 
            where we should go, and how we communicate with the essence of our lives." The professor Kim said he wish to 
            find the answer here. Did I find the answer? It was a short term, but I would say I can say the answer.`

            <p>Paper Study: I have read 35 papers across various fields during seminar and reviewed the paper review for all 6 
            weeks. In addition, I created the Github repository to organize my studies and to provide useful contents to any 
            visitor to my Github. (+not only about papers, but also organized codes related to the papers)
            Coding Study: I studied about the Python, Pytorch, and other codes including Transformers, VAT, CATs etc. Like 
            above, I also created the Github repository to organize my studies, that aiming to provide kind guide to any visitors 
            who come to my Github.
            Team Seminar / Meeting (Manipulation Team): During the research of ‘Style Transfer via INR’, I read 12 papers 
            related to Image-to-image translation and Style transfer and wrote the writings to summarize the things that I’ve 
            studied to my Github.
            Lab Seminar: I’ve learned about the Managing projects with Git, VAT, the diffusion model and about the 3D
            Geometric Variation from great lecturers.
            ECCV 2022 (I2I Team): For the ECCV 2022, I read 8 papers to study deeply to I2I, especially with the 
            unsupervised few-shot image-to-image translation to realize the multi-modal across multi-domains. Recently, I’m
            drawing figures that will be contained in the paper with team.
            Additional Projects and thoughts + Plans: In the end, all the things are connected: it comes from how we perceive
            the world. By researching the I2I and Style Transfer that I’m studying in the lab, I will connect these dots with the 
            cosmic fundamental dimension that I have desired for.
